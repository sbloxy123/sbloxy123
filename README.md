### Hey, I'm Stuart Bloxham ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Hertfordshire, England. Whilst having a strong background in client-facing roles I stumbled across Web Development and saw it as a great step forward in my career. Upon dipping my toes into the code, I was instantly hooked and wanted to build a career in the industry.

### Prior to joining Le Wagon Bootcamp I was self-taught in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & Gatsby. I decided to fully commit to getting into the industry by joining Le Wagon' Bootcamp where I picked up a more professional experience and a multitude of disciplines as a Full Stack Developer including Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Git, relational databases, and working with APIâ€™s, all whilst working with teammates through Slack, Git & Zoom.

### I'm currently advancing my Javascript skills and am learning Typescript. After this, I'm interested in NextJS and am keeping an eye on Svelte as the community grows.
