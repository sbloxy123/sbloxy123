### Hey, I'm Stuart Bloxham 👋 I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Hertfordshire, England.
### Here's a link to my portfolio - https://www.stuartbloxham.tech 😀

### About me 👨‍🦱:
Whilst having a strong background in client-facing roles I stumbled across Web Development and saw it as a great step forward in my career. Upon dipping my toes into the code, I was instantly hooked and wanted to build a career in the industry 🎉.

### Skills ⬆️:
Self-taught 🧑‍💻 in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & Gatsby then joined Le Wagon's Bootcamp 🧑‍🎓 where I picked up a more professional experience with a multitude of disciplines as a Full Stack Developer including Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Git, relational databases, and working with API’s, all whilst working with teammates 👬 through Slack, Git & Zoom.

### What's next 📚?
I'm currently advancing my Javascript skills, learning Typescript and improving my NextJS knowledge by building an ecommerce site among other mini projects. I'm also keeping an eye on Svelte as the community grows (I've heard it's a really great framework for developer experience!)
