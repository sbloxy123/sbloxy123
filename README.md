### Hey, I'm Stuart Bloxham 👋 I'm a Front End Developer based in Hertfordshire, England.
### Here's a link to my portfolio - https://www.stuartbloxham.co.uk 😀

### About me 👨‍🦱:
Currently building and maintaining websites at an Ed-Tech company using Vanilla JS, SCSS, HTML and ASP.NET. Also freelancing and studying in evenings and weekends, using more modern technologies such as React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Sanity.io to keep myself current within the industry 🎉.

### Skills ⬆️:
HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, React, Gatsby.js & Next.js, Github, Sanity.io CMS.
Joined Le Wagon's Bootcamp 🧑‍🎓 where I picked up a multitude of disciplines as a Full Stack Developer including Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Git, relational databases, and working with API’s, all whilst working with teammates to build web products 👬 through Slack, Git & Zoom.

### What's next 📚?
I'm currently advancing my Javascript skills, learning Typescript and improving my NextJS knowledge by building an ecommerce site among other mini projects. I'm also keeping an eye on Svelte as the community grows (I've heard it's a really great framework for developer experience!)
